## Structure of folder
Note: This folder is a also available as a GitHub respository ([link](https://github.com/timodaehler/COVID19DEBT-EXTENDED)). The folder structure contains the following elements: 

* Code (for all scripts)
* Data (for both raw and edited data)
* Plots (for output figures of scripts)
* Output (for final data files and tables)
* Text (for the document ready for dissemination) 


This project/repository contains all the R Scripts, data, and output and is work in progress. While sometimes time-intensive to read, the R scripts in this project are annotated in detail to alleviate minor amnesias and to make the code ready for collaboration and external review.

The constituent parts should be self-explanatory due to the careful naming. As an additional help, the documentation below acts as a log book to keep track of the different research steps taken. It also acts as a sticker note to record common decisions of the contributors. 

## Documentation
After the 33 country sample of the narrow project didn't render interesting results mostly due to the small sample size, we decided to increase the sample size to 155 countries.
